In Visual Studio Code, you can easily convert Markdown to HTML using a Markdown extension. One popular extension for this purpose is "Markdown All in One." Here's how you can install and use it:

1. **Install the "Markdown All in One" Extension:**
   
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Markdown All in One" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Install the extension.

2. **Convert Markdown to HTML:**

   - Open your Markdown file in Visual Studio Code.
   - Select the Markdown content you want to convert to HTML.
   - Right-click and select "Markdown: Open Preview to the Side" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+K V`.

   This will open a side-by-side preview of your Markdown file. On the top right corner of the preview, you'll find an icon with two overlapping squares. Click on it to switch to the HTML view. You will now see the HTML generated from your Markdown content.
