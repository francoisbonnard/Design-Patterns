# TDD


Reference : Test-Driven Dev by Kent Beck

## methodology

the trigger is implementing a requirement, not a class

System Under Test (SUT) is not a class, but the 'exports' from a module, its facade.

Do not write tests for implementation details (these change !), write tests against the stable contract of the API

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. 

## ATDD suites

Acceptance Test-Driven Development

- Acceptance Criteria: ATDD suites are designed based on the acceptance criteria specified for user stories or requirements. Acceptance criteria define the conditions that need to be met for a user story to be considered complete. These criteria serve as the basis for creating acceptance tests.

- Collaboration: ATDD encourages collaboration among developers, QA professionals, and business stakeholders. Together, they define acceptance tests that reflect the desired behavior of the software from both technical and business perspectives.

- Test Cases: Acceptance tests are written as test cases that verify the functionality of the software. These tests are automated whenever possible to enable continuous integration and regression testing.

- Validation: ATDD suites validate the software against the defined acceptance criteria. If the software passes all the acceptance tests, it is considered to meet the requirements and is ready for deployment.

- Feedback Loop: ATDD suites provide a feedback loop that helps teams quickly identify and address issues. If a test fails, it indicates that the software does not meet the specified criteria, prompting developers to make necessary adjustments.
