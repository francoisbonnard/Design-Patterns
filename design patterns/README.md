# Design-Patterns

Creational Design Patterns —Imagine you’re at a toy factory. Creational patterns are like the moulds used to create different toys. They define the best way to create objects in your JavaScript programs, ensuring that you’re making them efficiently and in a way that’s best suited for your needs.

Structural Design Patterns —Think of a Lego set. Structural patterns are like the instructions that show you how to assemble the pieces together. In JavaScript, these patterns help you put together different objects and classes to form larger structures, ensuring everything fits together neatly and efficiently.

Behavioural Design Patterns —Picture a team sport, like soccer. Each player has a role and a way they interact with other players. Behavioural patterns are like the strategies and play the team uses. In JavaScript, these patterns define how different objects and classes communicate and interact with each other, ensuring smooth teamwork and coordination.

## Creational Patterns

### 1. Abstract Factory

Let produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

Identification: The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

#### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the Abstract Factory design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

1. What classes does it consist of?
2. What roles do these classes play?
3. In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

### 2. Builder

Let construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
