# Design-Patterns

## Creational Patterns

### 1. Abstract Factory

Let produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

Identification: The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

#### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the Abstract Factory design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

1. What classes does it consist of?
2. What roles do these classes play?
3. In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

### 2. Builder

Let construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
