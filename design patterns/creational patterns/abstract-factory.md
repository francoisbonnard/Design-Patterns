# Creational Patterns

## Abstract Factory

Let produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

Identification: The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the Abstract Factory design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

1. What classes does it consist of?
2. What roles do these classes play?
3. In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
