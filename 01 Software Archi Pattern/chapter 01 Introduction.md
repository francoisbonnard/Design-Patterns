# Introduction

## Defining Software Architecture 3

    1.1 Structure of the system 
    1.2 Architecture Characteristics ("ilities") the system must support
    1.3 architecture decisions
    1.4 Design Principles 

1.1 microservices, layered, or
microkernel

1.2 Availability / Reliability / Testability
Scalability / Security / Agility
Fault Tolerance / Elasticity / Recoverability
Performance / Deployability / Learnability

Maintainability : developed for several years
Scalability : able to serve million of users
Reliability : available 24/7
Efficiency : short reponse latency


Here are a few key points about elasticity in software architecture:
Dynamic Scalability / Automatic Resource Provisioning / Load Balancing / Fault Tolerance: / Cost Optimization

1.3 the rules for how a system should be constructed, form the constraints of the system and direct the development teams on what is and what isn’t allowed
Most organizations have variance models that
are used by an architecture review board (ARB) or chief architect

1.4 (like SOLID principles)
or : development teams should leverage asynchronous messaging between services within a microservices architecture to increase performance


## Expectations of an Architect 8

• Make architecture decisions
• Continually analyze the architecture
• Keep current with latest trends
• Ensure compliance with decisions
• Diverse exposure and experience
• Have business domain knowledge
• Possess interpersonal skills
• Understand and navigate politics

## Laws of Software Architecture

    Everything in software architecture is a trade-off —First Law of Software Architecture

    If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely
    they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet —Corollary 1

    Why is more important than how —Second Law of Software Architecture

2. What is the difference between an architecture decision and a design principle?
3. List the eight core expectations of a software architect.
4. What is the First Law of Software Architecture?
